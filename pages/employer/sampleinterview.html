                        When it comes to the interview process, research and preparation for the interview can oftentimes determine your chances of making it to the next step. One of the best ways to get ready for a job interview is to practice your responses to the most common interview questions.
                        To help you get started, Glassdoor sifted through tens of thousands of interview reviews to find out some of the most common interview questions candidates get asked during recent interviews.

                An employment website is a web site that deals specifically with employment or careers. Many employment websites are designed to allow employers to post job requirements for a position to be filled and are commonly known as job boards. Other employment sites offer employer reviews, career and job-search advice, and describe different job descriptions or employers. Through a job website a prospective employee can locate and fill out a job application.
